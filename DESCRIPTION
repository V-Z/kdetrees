Title: Nonparametric method for identifying discordant phylogenetic trees

Description: A non-parametric method for identifying potential
    outlying observations in a collection of phylogenetic trees based
    on the methods of Owen and Provan (2011). Such discordant trees
    may indicate problems with sequence annotation or tree
    reconstruction, or they may represent interesting biological
    phenomena, such as horizontal gene transfers.
